# U&U

fundraiser tournament
past emails/documents as references
there's a document on the drive about how to run UU


schools will do stuff last minute and you have to accomodate them to get the money. busy the two weeks before the tournament

moving the tournament earlier is good because there's less school work then

coordinate MUT is also pretty difficult (getting people to come, and billet)

getting fields, food, etc. is rather straightforward


not that successful
- money was not lost
- did not make that much money
- get more people on MUT to show up

things to improve
- make it a commitment for current players
- people are tired on sunday because of going out on saturday. make the tournament format different?
- make purpose more clear: make money or have fun? 

financial side:
- make reimbursements very clear (save the receipts)

start planning as soon as you get the position. especially if its earlier. collect deposits from other schools so they don't drop out. collect housing deposits? so that people are held accountable if they make a mess. 

hat tournament style? 

sending out flyers now so that american schools can decide now.

3rd week of school would be better. but first week of school if we can get fields near mcgill. check conflicts with other tournaments

think about 5v5? would allow for more teams

Mac can handle 8 teams
Douglas does not have bathrooms (can get porta potties but expensive) or storage facilities

Actual location flexible (book both, cancel one)
