# MUT Executive Overview

## Club Composition
MUT is composed of four teams: mens A and B, and womens A and B. In the past three years, mens A and B and womens A have attended the same tournaments, while womens B has only attended Quebec tournaments and nationals (to lower cost). In general, it is safe to assume that both A teams will attend all tournaments so as to be competitive, and the B teams will decide how they would like to proceed in order to save money. Women's B has also billeted at certain tournaments (which is viable because the team is usually pretty small) to further save money.

## Fall Season
The season runs from the start of school in September until CUUC in mid-October. This is the busiest time of the year and requires that everyone be fully onboard. Tasks need to be completed in a timely manner so make calls and send emails as soon as possible.
### Practice Fields
In the past we have split time between the various fields that McGill has to offer, and Jeanne-Mance Park. McGill's Rutherford field, Molson Stadium, and Forbes field can be rented for very cheap rates, but they are rarely available due to intramurals and other sports teams. Jeanne-Mance has historically been the field for the A teams, while B teams either find other times or use their endzones. 
### Coaches
Most recently, Hoodie has coached Men's A, Isa and Shaunagh coached Women's A, Martin Brissette and Henry coached Men's B, and Andrea coached Women's B. The A teams usually find established coaches or players from the area, while the B teams may have former A team players serve as their coaches. 
### Jerseys
Our current jerseys are made by BE Ultimate. Their founder, Rumi Tejpar, is a McGill alum and has graciously offered us a good price on their gear. We usually open the team store over the summer (August or so) for returning players to order gear so that they may get it early on in the season. New players order gear as soon as teams are finalized so that they may have their kits in time for nationals.
### Tryouts
Tryouts are held at the beginning of the school year, usually in late August or early September. In the past, we've held them immediately before the start of school (which overlaps with frosh), or during the first week of school (which cuts into our season). Any earlier and people aren't even in the city yet. So a compromise will have to be made for the dates.
### Vans
Most van rental stores in the area require drivers be over 25 years of age. The only place that allows us to drive is Enterprise, which has an agreement through McGill. When

### Tournaments
The primary tournaments that MUT competes in are:
- Coupe Quebec I
    - Saturday
- Coupe Quebec II (CQUUC)
    - Saturday
    - can earn bid to Nationals
- Easterns (CEUUC)
    - Saturday and Sunday
    - can earn bid to Nationals
- Nationals (CUUC)
    - Friday (qualifiers), Saturday, Sunday

Official rules can be found on the Ultimate Canada website, but in general teams must perform well at their regional qualifiying tournaments to avoid attending the Friday qualifier at Nationals. Depending on scheduling, MUT A teams will attend at least one of CQUUC or CEUUC. 

B teams that are looking to lower their team fees can opt to forego attending Easterns, as it requires several hours of travel and overnight accomodations.
#### Coupe Quebec I
The first tournament of the year. This is usually held in Montreal or Sherbrooke and serves as a seeding tournament for Coupe Quebec II. Usually all teams will attend.
#### Coupe Quebec II (CQUUC)
This is a bid-earning tournament, but has been scheduled for the same weekend as Easterns two years in a row. The winning team gets 48 cans of hard cider. Mens A won in 2018.
#### Easterns (CEUUC)
Another bid earning tournament that has previously overlapped Coupe Quebec II. Usually competing teams will elect to attend this tournament because it gives them exposure to Ontario teams before Nationals. In 2018 there was more than one bid available in each division. 
#### Nationals (CUUC)


## Spring Season
We have considered competing in the USAU College series, but it has never happened before. Travel may be fairly expensive (depending on tournament locations), and we would have to register with USAU (refer to their website). Furthermore, we would need to find fields to practice on, which would be difficult with Montreal weather.
