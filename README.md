## 1. Club Composition
MUT is composed of four teams: mens A and B, and womens A and B. In the past three years, mens A and B and womens A have attended the same tournaments, while womens B has only attended Quebec tournaments and nationals (to lower cost). In general, it is safe to assume that both A teams will attend all tournaments so as to be competitive, and the B teams will decide how they would like to proceed in order to save money. Women's B has also billeted at certain tournaments (which is viable because the team is usually pretty small) to further save money.

## 2. Fall Season
The season runs from the start of school in September until CUUC in mid-October. This is the busiest time of the year and requires that everyone be fully onboard. Tasks need to be completed in a timely manner so make calls and send emails as soon as possible.
### Practice Fields
In the past we have split time between the various fields that McGill has to offer, and Jeanne-Mance Park. McGill's Rutherford field, Molson Stadium, and Forbes field can be rented for very cheap rates, but they are rarely available due to intramurals and other sports teams. Jeanne-Mance has historically been the field for the A teams, while B teams either find other times or use their endzones. 
### Coaches
Most recently, Hoodie has coached Men's A, Isa and Shaunagh coached Women's A, Martin Brissette and Henry coached Men's B, and Andrea coached Women's B. The A teams usually find established coaches or players from the area, while the B teams may have former A team players serve as their coaches. 
### Jerseys
Our current jerseys are made by BE Ultimate. Their founder, Rumi Tejpar, is a McGill alum and has graciously offered us a good price on their gear. We usually open the team store over the summer (August or so) for returning players to order gear so that they may get it early on in the season. New players order gear as soon as teams are finalized so that they may have their kits in time for nationals.
### Tryouts
Tryouts are held at the beginning of the school year, usually in late August or early September. In the past, we've held them immediately before the start of school (which overlaps with frosh), or during the first week of school (which cuts into our season). Any earlier and people aren't even in the city yet. So a compromise will have to be made for the dates.
### Vans
Most van rental stores in the area require drivers be over 25 years of age. The only place that allows younger people to drive is Enterprise, which has an agreement through McGill. Vans (or cars) are reserved and can be picked up at one of their many locations. Usually we go to the ones on Guy or St Laurent because they are the largest and are able handle the volume that we request (~10 cars). For early morning departures (ie. Coupe Quebec), vans should be reserved for the night before. McGill offers a student discount and insurance, so no extra coverage is needed. Make sure to book in advance (at least a week, preferably more) so that they can get the cars.
### Accommodation
Usually we stay in hotels near the competition fields. We have considered AirBnB but places are often scarce, far, or expensive (and often all three). Consider booking over the summer before the start of school because accomodation goes fast and we need a lot of it. Try and find hotels that are relatively flexible with cancellations because earning a bid can be random and effects whether we go to Nationals on Thursday night or Friday night.
### Tournaments
The primary tournaments that MUT competes in are:
- Coupe Quebec I
    - Saturday
- Coupe Quebec II (CQUUC)
    - Saturday
    - can earn bid to Nationals
- Easterns (CEUUC)
    - Saturday and Sunday
    - can earn bid to Nationals
- Nationals (CUUC)
    - Friday (qualifiers), Saturday, Sunday

Official rules can be found on the Ultimate Canada website, but in general teams must perform well at their regional qualifiying tournaments to avoid attending the Friday qualifier at Nationals. Depending on scheduling, MUT A teams will attend at least one of CQUUC or CEUUC. 

B teams that are looking to lower their team fees can opt to forego attending Easterns, as it requires several hours of travel and overnight accomodations.
#### Coupe Quebec I
The first tournament of the year. This is usually held in Montreal or Sherbrooke and serves as a seeding tournament for Coupe Quebec II. Usually all teams will attend.
#### Coupe Quebec II (CQUUC)
This is a bid-earning tournament, but has been scheduled for the same weekend as Easterns two years in a row. The winning team gets 48 cans of hard cider. Mens A won in 2018.
#### Easterns (CEUUC)
Another bid earning tournament that has previously overlapped Coupe Quebec II. Usually competing teams will elect to attend this tournament because it gives them exposure to Ontario teams before Nationals. In 2018 there was more than one bid available in each division. 
#### Nationals (CUUC)
Nationals takes place in mid-October. In the past it has been held in Montreal, Ottawa, and Brampton. For A teams, vans will depart Thursday night if a bid has not been earned, and Friday night if a bid has been earned. B teams will always depart on Friday night.

## 3. Spring Season
We have considered competing in the USAU College series, but it has never happened before. Travel may be fairly expensive (depending on tournament locations), and we would have to register with USAU (refer to their website). Furthermore, we would need to find fields to practice on, which would be difficult with Montreal weather. If we do pursue the USAU circuit it is likely we will start with the A teams and expand to the B teams. 
### Instructions
According to USAU, the instructions for signing up are as follows:

    For a Canadian team, the process is pretty much the same as for US teams, with one exception. You will need to get your team set up online, get your roster verified by your registrar, and sign up for your conference championship like other teams. For instructions on how to sign up online, and have your roster verified, you can check out our how-to documents here: https://play.usaultimate.org/members/help/#College. The documents are set up for 2018, but the process will be largely the same next year, although 2019 registration doesn't open until December. 
### Roster Composition
We will most likely hold another round of tryouts to fill out the roster, as it is possible that players from the fall season will not be available in the Spring. 
### Practice Fields
TBD. Most fields are available in the Spring once it gets warm enough. Until then we will probably reserve indoor spaces in the field house or gym.
### Transportation
Same as in the Fall. Reserve vans from Enterprise.
### Accomodation
Hotels or AirBnB. AirBnB is usually cheaper in the US so it is more worth considering.

## 4. Administrative Matters
### Publicity
Tryouts for the Fall Season take place before the start of school (and thus before activities night). Thus, we need to have a very strong online presence through our website and social media accounts.

Tabling at the Y intersection during the week before the start of school is the best means of reaching out to the first year students before tryouts. We can have a few team members toss around on the lower field and try to engage people and recruit them.

Fall Activities Night takes place after tryouts. Thus we may not be able to get many recruits, but we can still spread the word. Winter Activities night is much the same, but it is closer to fall tryouts. If we decide to play a spring season with USAU, Winter would be a good time to advertise it.
### Fundraising
- Samosa/Churro Sales
- U&U
- Other events:
  - Apartment Crawl
  - Clinics
- Sponsorships
### Social Media
The social media team is responsible for showing off our activities and keeping the fans up to date. This can include occasional posts and pictures summarizing our work, as well potentially having live score updates. They also need to post for our sponsors.

## 5. Events
### Unleashed and Untrained
A fundraising tournament hosted each year by the club to raise funds for the next year. The tournament usually takes place in mid-October after CUUC. We invite teams from the nearby area (they do not need to be affiliated with schools) to come to Montreal for a weekend of ultimate, along with a Montreal bagels, a BBQ lunch, and a tournament party. Teams are invited to billet with members of MUT so that they do not need to pay for housing.
### Banquet
Banquet is usually held around November to recap the season and recognize players with awards. Team captains usually prepare funny awards for each member of the team, and then organize polls to vote for MVP, rookie of the year, and most improved player. MUT executives are responsible for booking a venue (Gert's or Thompson House), organizing food (usually something small), and making sure a microphone, speakers, and projectors are present.
