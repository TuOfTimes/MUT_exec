# Elected Executives for MUT 2019

## President
The president is responsible for ensuring that the club operates smoothly.

## Vice President
The second in command in the club. S/he is responsible for keeping the club in check when the President is not around, and for answering to the President.

## Vice President - Finance
Responsible for handling all the money that flows into and out of the club. S/he should keep clean records of all transactions, including supporting documents, and perform the club audit at the end of the Fall and Winter semesters.

## Logistics
Responsible for booking transportation and accomodation for all teams during the season. After the end of the season, s/he is responsible for organizing intramurals and other pick-up games.

## Outreach
Responsible for engaging and expanding the MUT community. This includes tabling at the Y intersection during OAP and organizing materials and volunteers for Fall and Winter activities night.

## Fundraising
Responsible for raising funds for the team as a whole. This includes tabling to sell samosas, churros, etc. as well as any other means of fundraising that one can come up with. Could also be responsible for finding sponsorships (which need to be confirmed with SSMU).

## U&U and Events (2 people)
U&U is McGill's very own fundraising tournament, held annually in the Fall. The tournament takes a lot of preparation and organization, so this year we are putting two people in charge. After the season, these two execs will be responsible for organizing and publicizing "fun" events that will keep the team engaged and socializing (ex. apartment crawls, laser tag, etc.)

## Other Positions
### Photographer
We're hoping to have someone who doesn't play come out to our tournaments and take photos. We would cover transportation and accomodation and they'd come hang out (ideally a former player that is no longer eligible).

### Social Media
Post on social media and respond to messages on social media.
