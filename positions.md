# Elected Executives for MUT 2019

## President
The president is responsible for ensuring that the club operates smoothly.

## Vice President
The second in command. S/he will split responsibilities with the President to ensure that the club runs smoothly. These responsibilities may include: planning and organizing tryouts, booking hotels and transportation for tournaments, submitting bids and ensuring that all player information (ex. proof of enrollment, Ultimate Canada/FQU numbers) is accounted for, etc.

## Vice President - Finance
Responsible for handling all the money that flows into and out of the club. S/he should keep clean records of all transactions, including supporting documents, and perform the club audit at the end of the Fall and Winter semesters.

## Outreach
Responsible for engaging and expanding the MUT community. This includes tabling at the Y intersection during OAP and organizing materials and volunteers for Fall and Winter activities night. This year we are also going to try and host workshops and pickup games to get other people involved.

## Fundraising
Responsible for raising funds for the team as a whole. This includes tabling to sell samosas, churros, etc. as well as any other means of fundraising that one can come up with. S/he would also be responsible for finding sponsorship and confirming them with SSMU.

## U&U and Events (2 people)
U&U is MUT's very own fundraising tournament, held annually in the Fall. The tournament takes a lot of preparation and organization, so this year we are putting two people in charge. These execs will also be responsible for organizing the Banquet at the end of the season, as well as "fun" events that will keep the team engaged and socializing into the winter semester (ex. apartment crawls, laser tag, etc.).

## Other Positions
### Photographer
This position would ideally be held by someone who does not plan on playing with a team, but wants to hang out and come along to tournaments. S/he would travel with us to tournaments (transportation and accommodation completely covered) and take photos of the teams as they play. Prior experience is preferred but not mandatory.

### Social Media
Engage the online community. This may include posting tournament results on Twitter and exciting photos on Instagram, as well as responding to emails and messages on social media.
